# TechTune Motors Website - Internship Project

Welcome to TechTune Motors, your one-stop solution for all your vehicle servicing needs! Our website is designed and developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to provide you with a seamless and efficient experience. Whether you need to book a service, arrange for service collection, or request a callback, we've got you covered.

## Features

### 1. **Booking Service**
Easily schedule your vehicle service appointments with our intuitive booking system. Select your preferred date and time, choose the type of service you need, and leave the rest to us. Our experienced technicians will take care of your vehicle, ensuring it's in top-notch condition.

### 2. **Service Collection**
We understand that your time is valuable. That's why we offer a convenient service collection option. If you're unable to bring your vehicle to our workshop, simply request a service collection. Our team will pick up your vehicle at your specified location, perform the necessary services, and return it to you once the work is completed.

### 3. **Call Back Facility**
Have questions or need assistance? Use our call back facility to request a call from our customer support team. Provide your contact details and a brief description of your inquiry, and we'll get back to you at your preferred time. Our friendly and knowledgeable staff are here to assist you with any queries you may have.

## Technologies Used
